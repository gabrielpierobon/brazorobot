NicolaiBolas, a renowned MTG content creator, has recently released a comprehensive guide on how to succeed in the Lord of the Rings Draft. This guide is packed with valuable insights, from ranking the top commons for each color to providing an overview of every archetype. Let's dive into the key takeaways from this guide.</p>\n\n<h2>Set Mechanics</h2>\n\n<p>The Lord of the Rings Draft introduces two new mechanics: The Ring and Amass Orcs. The Ring mechanic tempts you with an emblem that gains abilities as the game progresses, while Amass Orcs allows you to build up an orc army by adding +1/+1 counters to an existing army or creating a new one if none exists.</p>\n\n<h2>Top Commons for Each Color</h2>\n\n<p>NicolaiBolas ranks the top commons for each color, providing insights into their strengths and how they can be utilized effectively. For instance, in white, Hobbit's Sting and Protector of Gondor are highly recommended, while in blue, Glorious Gale and Aphelian Kingfisher are top picks. In black, Claim the Precious and Dunland Cribane are favored, while red's top commons include Smite the Deathless and Rally the Hornberg. Lastly, in green, Many Partings and Generous Ent are considered the best.</p>\n\n<h2>Color Rankings</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to color rankings, NicolaiBolas suggests using these as a tiebreaker for close picks. All colors are powerful, but it's best to find the open color and draft that deck. The color rankings are as follows: Blue, Green, White, Black, and Red.</p>\n\n<h2>Archetype Overviews</h2>\n\n<p>The guide provides an overview of each archetype, discussing their strengths and key cards. For instance, Red-White is a human token aggro deck that utilizes cards like Theoden, King of Rohan, and Erkenbrand. Blue-Black is an Amass control deck that leverages cards like The Mouth of Sauron and Gandalf, Friend of the Shire. Each color combination has its unique playstyle and strategy, and understanding these can give you an edge in the draft.</p>\n\n<h2>Combat Tricks and Traps</h2>\n\n<p>Being aware of the common combat tricks in each color can prevent you from getting blown out during games. For example, in white, watch out for Escape from Orthank and Second Breakfast, while in blue, Deceive the Messenger and Dreadful as the Storm are common tricks. NicolaiBolas also warns against certain trap cards like Ringside and Rising of the Day, which may seem good but often underperform.</p>\n\n<h2>Combos and Mana Fixing</h2>\n\n<p>The guide also highlights some powerful combos you can assemble with just commons and uncommons. For example, Erkenbrand, Lord of Westfold, and Rally at the Hornberg can lead to a massive attack, while Grishnakh, Brash Instigator, and Lash of the Balrog can eliminate your opponent's creatures. NicolaiBolas also discusses the mana fixing available at common in the set, such as Shire Terrace and Great Hall of the Citadel, which can help ensure you have the right mana to cast your spells.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, NicolaiBolas's Lord of the Rings Draft Guide is an invaluable resource for anyone looking to improve their draft skills and understanding of the game. Whether you're preparing for your first draft or looking to crush your competition, this guide has all the information you need.

The world's best open-source Chat AI!</strong>\". The video announces the launch of OpenAssistant, an open-source AI assistant developed through a global community effort.</p>\n\n<p>OpenAssistant is the result of extensive work that began before Christmas. The team has built a data collection platform and gathered over <strong>600,000 interactions</strong> with humans, including 150,000 messages of human demonstrations of being an assistant. This has led to the creation of over 10,000 fully annotated conversation trees, covering a wide range of topics in numerous languages.</p>\n\n<p>The project has been supported by contributions from over <strong>13,000 volunteers</strong> worldwide. The team has trained models on this data, finding it to be unique and valuable. All the resources, including the dataset, code, chat interface, and a paper on the project, are open source and publicly available.</p>\n\n<p>The chat interface is the recommended platform for interacting with these models. The models, based on Llama and Pythia, are designed to fit into a single GPU. The Pythia-based models are fully open source and business-friendly. The team encourages users to contribute back to the project in any way they can.</p>\n\n<p>One of the highlighted features of OpenAssistant is its ability to interact with third-party systems. A user named Dragon demonstrated how the model can interact with Google to retrieve information dynamically.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, OpenAssistant represents a significant achievement in the field of open-source AI. It is a testament to the power of community collaboration and the potential of AI.</p>\n\n<h2>Relevant Links:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://open-assistant.io\">OpenAssistant</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant\">OpenAssistant's GitHub Repository</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1\">OpenAssistant's Dataset on Hugging Face</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ykilcher.com/oa-paper\">OpenAssistant's Paper</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "video": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ddG2fM9i4Kk", "likes": 0, "author": "Gabriel Pierobon"}]
