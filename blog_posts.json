Players must tap lands (cards representing magical energy sources) to generate mana, which is used to pay for the casting costs of spells and abilities.</p>\n\n<h2>Formats</h2>\n\n<p>MTG offers different formats to play, including:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Standard</strong>: A rotating format that includes the most recent sets.</li>\n<li><strong>Modern</strong>: A non-rotating format that includes a larger pool of cards.</li>\n<li><strong>Commander</strong>: A multiplayer format with unique deck-building rules, centered around legendary creatures.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Markdown Syntax</h2>\n\n<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text.
